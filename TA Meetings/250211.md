#### First meeting with John Li (TA)
#### February 11, 2025
**In attendance:**
- Deepika Batra
- John Li
- Li Padilla
- Rawnie Singh


#### Notes
- Block Diagram
    - Safety check? would recommend putting it in; whether we actually have it done
    - Battery voltage rate (what kind of battery)-- lithium ion
    - Find glove and figure out how much it needs (figure out by Thursday and get number in block diagram)
    - Some groups using 11.1-12V batteries
- Glove Explanation
    - Explaining overarching goal of the glove design
    - Says wireless better (more complex than bluetooth (?))
    - Make sure to specify protocol in the communication (wifi/bluetooth)
    - Keep in mind any back-up plans
        - if wireless fails, if we can default to a wired setup try to have that ready
- High-level requirements (have at least 2 quantifiable metrics)
    - 80% "accuracy" is vague-- would have to find a way to graph it (analytic feature for the developer or added into the application)-- ground truth to compare it to? 
        - could look at data and apply it to metrics
        - if 80% of the time it actually succeeds/identifies it properly for the user that could be accuracy?
        - make sure we *specify* this more;
    - unique user compatibility
        - "should function as expected" 
        - making comparisons with threshold values with the sensors (unique from person-to-person)
        - want to see if this maintains from person-to-person
        - still suffers from the same problem as the first requirement make sure this is fleshed out more
        - for 2 diff people- system should be able to detect that the person should rest their hand of hand movements
    - user interactions
        - propose hand and wrist stretches
        - quantifiable metric for this?
        - are they the correct hand stretches that the user should do? 
        - ie "when drawing for 2 hours-- the recommended hand stretch from doctors the recommended stretch is X" 
        - flesh out that the recommendations are from the sensors
- Subsystem requirements
    - looks good, the numbers are good
    - project proposal webpage-- make sure you follow that before submitting
    - include list of requirements where, if removed, the subsystem would fail to function
- If we need a machine shop, get it done before this Friday
- Dev boards? -- they're ok for debugging and breadboarding but not expected to see on final PCB; MCUs should be directly soldered on the board and the motor controllers should be chips and not dev boards
- weekly meeting time & communication method
    - email works fine; discord (?)
    - weekly meeting times
- **lockers** they ran out of lockers apparently.. whenever you're free, visit ECEB 3082 and any 445 TAs, ask for a sign-out sheet for a locker
