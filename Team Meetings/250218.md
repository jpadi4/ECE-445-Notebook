    - Will create a new directory for team meetings 

**Meeting Agenda:**
- What will the glove look like?
    - What muscles and which sensors are placed where?
    - How many strain gauges (exactly)?
    - How many IMUs (1)?
    - How will we implement wireless/bluetooth
    - PCB on the glove itself?
- If we have time, we should set aside time next week to work together to design the PCB (PCB review is on 2/28)
- We can make a calendar? Or a kanban board? (Design document due 3/3 and Breadboard demo due week of 3/10 !!) **i will make a kanban board**

**Proposal Review Preparation:**

**Future PCB Design Experimentation**
