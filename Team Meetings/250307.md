# March 7 Meeting
**In attendance:**
- Deepika Batra
- Li Padilla
- Rawnie Singh


- decided on buying this glove https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Compression-Glove-Black-One-Size/1607706655?fulfillmentIntent=Pickup&filters=%5B%7B%22intent%22%3A%22fulfillmentIntent%22%2C%22values%22%3A%5B%22Pickup%22%5D%7D%5D&classType=VARIANT&athbdg=L1200&from=/search
    - fabric seems thin enough but 'stiff' enough to provide enough strength to bend the wheatstone bridge
- finally received strain gauges and are testing out creating the wheatstone bridge
    - (Li) soldered additional wires onto the strain gauge leads so they are able to be placed on the breadboard easier
    - (Deepika) set up the breadboard for the resistance configuration
    - (Rawnie) placed the strain gauges on the card itself and set up the power configuration (voltage and current)

- getting ~3.1 mV (between constant resistance and strain gauges) without any strain 
    - option to change resitance of the 
    
- recording applying strain and voltage differences at different angles to get a general idea of how much we need to amplify voltages
- when we experimented with the bending of the strain gauge, we see a decrease in voltage (from 3.00 mV to about 2.947 mV) when bending the strain gauge approximately -30 degrees (30 degrees "down" below the table)
    - -0.06mV
- starting at 2.97 mV and bending the strain gauges 30 degrees (30 degrees "up" in reference to the table) and got 3.01 mV (0.03 mV)


## For next meeting, Sunday
- have the compression glove, do a half wheatstone bridge with the glove
- based on the readings with the glove, build the voltage amplifier
- BRING A PROTRACTOR!!
