# March 7 Meeting

- decided on buying this glove https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Compression-Glove-Black-One-Size/1607706655?fulfillmentIntent=Pickup&filters=%5B%7B%22intent%22%3A%22fulfillmentIntent%22%2C%22values%22%3A%5B%22Pickup%22%5D%7D%5D&classType=VARIANT&athbdg=L1200&from=/search
    - fabric seems thin enough but 'stiff' enough to provide enough strength to bend the wheatstone bridge
- finally received strain gauges and are testing out creating the wheatstone bridge
    - (Li) soldered additional wires onto the strain gauge leads so they are able to be placed on the breadboard easier
    - (Deepika) set up the breadboard for the resistance configuration
    - (Rawnie) placed the strain gauges on the card itself and set up the power configuration (voltage and current)
