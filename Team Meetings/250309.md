## Meeting agenda
- have the compression glove, do a half wheatstone bridge with the glove
- based on the readings with the glove, build the voltage amplifier
- BRING A PROTRACTOR!! 

### Notes
- took the MCU/ISP from PCB assingment out to be used on our breadboard
- began designing the voltage amplifier 
    - used to amplify the output voltage from the wheatstone bridge; the magnitude of output voltage from the wheatstone bridge design to convert change in resistance (from strain gauges) into measurable voltage is in mV
- looking into how to display data from the MCU 
    - using opamp (LM2904)
