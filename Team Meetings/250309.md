## Meeting agenda
- have the compression glove, do a half wheatstone bridge with the glove
- based on the readings with the glove, build the voltage amplifier
- BRING A PROTRACTOR!! 

### Notes
- took the MCU/ISP from PCB assingment out to be used on our breadboard
- Deepika and Rawni began designing the voltage amplifier 
    - used to amplify the output voltage from the wheatstone bridge; the magnitude of output voltage from the wheatstone bridge design to convert change in resistance (from strain gauges) into measurable voltage is in mV
- Li looking into how to transmit data from op-amp/MCU breadboard to computer via UART
    - using opamp (LM2904)

- problem that we ran into:
    - voltage is being amplified when it shouldn't be ? 
    - switched to LM358 (low-power op-amp), seeing a better magnitude than with the previous Op-Amp, seeking to order a different op-amp that is more accurate
    - 4th pin in new chip connected to ground
    - can increase the gain to be usable w the microcontroller
    - **our gain is 3x higher than we expect; order a new op-amp that's accurate after the breadboard demo; this op-amp is not suited to detect voltages that small**
    - trying to amplify to 1.1 mV; we're reaching around 0.9V 
    - only switching the numerator value resistor for the op-amp instead of the denominator 
- UART won't happen by breadboard demo (missing USB 2.0 to DIP) 
    - we'll be able to have 1.1V as input to the MCU for the ADC 
    - new plan to show that the op-amp -> MCU -> communication display is actually connected, we'll show an LED that lights up when the input voltage exceeds 1.1V 


## List to order
- low-power/high-precision op-amp designed for very small voltages to eliminate error
    - NCV5230 ? voltage supply as low as 1.8 V or as high as 15 V
- female USB
