## Meeting objectives
- Experiment creating a half wheatstone bridge with the glove and strain gauges
- Based on the readings with the glove, build the voltage amplifier

## What was accomplished
- Took the MCU/ISP from PCB assignment out to be used on our breadboard
- From the previous meeting, we began designing a half-wheatstone bridge for our strain gauge configuration. One strain gauge is designed to compress and one strain gauge is designed to contract. The equation for the output voltage of the bridge can be is: $$V_o = (\frac{R_3}{R_3+R_4}-\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}) *V_{EX}$$
    - "Alternatively, you can double the sensitivity of the bridge to strain by making both gauges active, although in different
directions. For example, Figure 6 illustrates a bending beam application with one bridge mounted in tension (RG + ∆R)
and the other mounted in compression (RG – ∆R). This half-bridge configuration, whose circuit diagram is also illustrated in Figure 6, yields an output voltage that is linear and approximately doubles the output of the quarter-bridge
circuit." [1]

    - $$GF = 2$$
    Strain gauges with a GF of 2 will exhibit a change in electrical resistance of [2] :  $$2(500*10^{-6})=0.1$$ 
    - Therefore, $$V_out = \frac{3.7}{2}*2*0.005=18.5 mV$$
- Deepika and Rawnie began designing the voltage amplifier  
    - This is used to amplify the output voltage from the wheatstone bridge; the magnitude of output voltage from the wheatstone bridge design to convert change in resistance (from strain gauges) into measurable voltage is in mV
    - For the signal to be readable to the microcontroller's analog input pins, its voltage must be amplified to 1.1V
    - Creating a non-inverting amplifier circuit:
        - $$Gain = 1+\frac{R_f}{R_g}$$
        - Want to see a gane of approximately 60, so Rf = 60kOhms and Rg = 1kOhms is a suitable ratio
        - Rf is the feedback resistor and Rg is the ground resistor


- Problem that we ran into:
    - Voltage is being amplified when it shouldn't be ? 
    - Switched to LM358 (low-power op-amp), seeing a better magnitude than with the previous Op-Amp, seeking to order a different op-amp that is more accurate
    - 4th pin in new chip connected to ground
    - can increase the gain to be usable w the microcontroller
    - **our gain is 3x higher than we expect; order a new op-amp that's accurate after the breadboard demo; this op-amp is not suited to detect voltages that small**
    - Trying to amplify to 1.1 mV; we're reaching around 0.9V 
    - Only switching the numerator value resistor for the op-amp instead of the denominator 
- Landed on op-amp configuration that yielded somewhat consistent values
    - Angle 0, vdiff = 3.1V
    - Angle -30, vdiff = 2.947
    - Angle 30, vdiff = 3.010 V

- Li looking into how to transmit data from op-amp/MCU breadboard to computer via UART
    - using opamp (LM2904)
- UART won't happen by breadboard demo (missing USB 2.0 to DIP) 
    - we'll be able to have 1.1V as input to the MCU for the ADC 
    - new plan to show that the op-amp -> MCU -> communication display is actually connected, we'll show an LED that lights up when the input voltage exceeds 1.1V
