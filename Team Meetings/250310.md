## Meeting agenda
#### Order list
- new op-amp
- MCU
- adhesive for strain gauges
- battery

* voltage regulator(s)?

We have
- differential gain amplifier
- strain gauge circuit/wheatstone bridge
- leave space for IMUs and filter for IMU
- leave space for voltage regulator 
- have to test the new amplifier before printing on new PCB
- 2nd round place what we have so far
- 3rd round place everything else that we need
