## Meeting agenda
### Order list
- we are ordering our own PCB (2-3 weeks?)
    - 1 version with ATTiny, op-amp, 1 half-bridge strain gauge, LED, circuit path
    - 1 version with IMU
- 5 surfacemount op-amps LM4562? 
- usbc(?) surface mount
- usbc(?w) uart cable
- 3.3 mohm resistor
- (2 * 3 * 2) 350 ohm resistor (for wheatstone bridge)
- 3.3V rechargeable battery
- 3 atmega328p (compatiable with 6-pin ISP)

### pending email inquiries
- strain guage adhesive
- can we have multiple PCB designs in one round
- MCU part pick-up (unsure if it's surface mount or throughhole)
- 6-pin ISP (multiple of these)

### things that don't depend on PCB
- mounting strain gauges onto the glove itself
    - adhesive
    - strain gauge leads
- microcontroller program
    - version with IMU input, LED output
    - version with
