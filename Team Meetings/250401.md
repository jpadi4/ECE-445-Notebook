**In attendance:**
- Deepika Batra
- Li Padilla
- Rawnie Singh

## Meeting objectives
- Order parts

## What was accomplished
- parts ordered
    - we are ordering our own PCB (2-3 weeks?)
        - 1 version with ATTiny, op-amp, 1 half-bridge strain gauge, LED, circuit path
        - 1 version with IMU
    - 5 surfacemount op-amps LM4562? 
    - usbc(?) surface mount
    - usbc(?w) uart cable
    - 3.3 mohm resistor
    - (2 * 3 * 2) 350 ohm resistor (for wheatstone bridge)
    - 3.3V rechargeable battery
    - 3 atmega328p (compatiable with 6-pin ISP)

- sent emails
    - strain guage adhesive
    - can we have multiple PCB designs in one round?
    - MCU part pick-up (unsure if it's surface mount or throughhole)
    - 6-pin ISP (multiple of these)

- delegate things that don't necessarily depend on PCB
    - mounting strain gauges onto the glove itself [2]
        - adhesive
        - strain gauge leads
    - microcontroller program
        - version with IMU input, LED output
        - version to test Strain gauges, LED output - ADC required [2]

## To Do
- Order PCB
- Pick up ordered parts
- Write microcontroller program
