# April 20, 2025
**In attendance:**
- Deepika Batra
- Li Padilla
- Rawnie Singh

## Meeting agenda
- putting together the wire connectors, actually program the MCU
- Li soldered on the switch, more wire connectors, and op-amps
- Rawnie and Deepika work together to crimp wires for the strain gauge
- **Problem:** USBC ttl pin does not fit the PCB :(

## What was completed
- Li soldered on the switch, more wire connectors, and op-amps
- Rawnie and Deepika worked together to crimp wires for the strain gauge
- Prepare for the Mock Demo
    - Still testing strain gauges on the PCB implementation of the circuit, but the amplification is not really working
    - Trying to go through the R&V tables and ensure that the chips are properly powered without issue
- Unfortunately could not exactly figure out why the MCU is not being programmed
    - All the connections from ISP<->MCU are good except for MISO
    - The MCU is soldered on fine, did a continuinty check on each pin. the MISO pin on the ISP isnt though
    - Going to test getting a new cable when a TA is available the next day
