**In attendance:**
- Deepika Batra
- Rawnie Singh

## Meeting agenda
- Li plans on coming in to glue the strain gauges onto the glove
- once all of the coponents are soldered onto the board, then we can begin to debug the IMU programming

## What was completed
- Figured out a reason as to why the MCUs were not being programmed (faulty cable)
- Able to test using new cable and Attiny85
- Test program LED lights up and reads vdiff using the Attiny85 MCU
    - this means that strain gauge -> wheatstone bridge -> MCU -> LED signal path is working
