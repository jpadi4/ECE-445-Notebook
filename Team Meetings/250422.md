**In attendance:**
- Deepika Batra
- Li Padilla

## Meeting agenda
- solder new MCU 
- test programming MCU
- run burn bootloader, program MCU with no errors

## What was completed
- soldered new MCU
- continuity checks for MCU pins pass
- added zener diode between ISP and the VCC on the MCU
    - now able to write simple program to the MCU; MCU is detectable by programmer
    - had to add a zener diode to protect the MCU as the MCU is being programmed by the ISP
- soldering/testing 1st strain gauge
    - soldered all of the capacitors/resistors
    - did continuity check on all newly-soldered parts to ensure they are soldered correctly
