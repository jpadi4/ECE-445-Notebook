## Meeting agenda
- measure the current coming out of the opamp
- do the math to find a resistance that will drop that current to < 40 mA 

## What was accomplished
- note: new PCB expected to arrive on Monday evening
- seeing voltage of 2V for the strain gauge difference (but LED voltage was 4V)
    - 2V is fine, but the current value was likely too high

- attemping to decrease the current going through vdiff, but maintaining the gain ratio
    - switched the resistance of the op-amp gain amplifier to 1MOhm (from 3.3MOhm), but the output voltage gain & output current seems to be the same
    - input current to op-amp: 11mA (nom resistance side) / 16 microAmps (strain gauge side) (ideally want an output current of 30 amps)

- measure the current coming out of the opamp
    - 41 mA - current from vdiff/ground (strain gauge unbent)
    - 40.6 mA - current (yellow wire expanding- )
- measure the voltage coming out of the opamp
    - 2.4 V (no bend)
    - 
- measure resistance change 
    - rest 344 ohm
    - bend up 343.8 ohm 
    - bend down 344.8 ohm
