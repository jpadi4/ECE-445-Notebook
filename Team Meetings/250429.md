**In attendance:**
- Deepika Batra
- Li Padilla
- Rawnie Singh

## Meeting agenda
- figure out what is causing UART issues
- figure out op-amp issues
- implement IMU
- debug and test our UART -> Python code

## What was accomplished
#### Sensor layer subsystem (Rawnie)
##### IMU research (Li)
- operating VDD for our imu (ICM-20948) is 1.7V-3.6V
- designing a way to reliably and consistently have a voltage drop
- **problem:** forgot that the operating voltage of the IMU is 1.7V-3.6V, but our VCC Li-Po battery is 3.7V
  - option 1: schottky diode (1N5817 or 1N5819) to lower the voltage ~0.3V

$V_{out}=V_{in} - V_f$
- $V_{in}$ is VCC = 3.7V
- $V_f$ = ~0.3V (voltage drop for diode)
- note that Vf varies w/ current... anticipating a current of roughly 10-30mA; ICM draws < 10mA so $V_f$ is about 0.3V
- C2 (grounding capacitor) between diode's cathod and IMU's VCC pin:
    - diodes output V can have fluctionations/noise, and capacitor prevents voltage spikes
    - capacitor provides instant current, preventing voltage strings
    - ie if IMU draws 10mA, diode output will briefly drop (but with capacitor, it maintains 3.4V)

#### Signal processing subsystem (Rawnie)
- PCB mounting
    - since we unfortunately didn't foresee issues with our op-amp part, (specifically, the difference between surface mount and through-hole), we decided to use a small breadboard in tandem with the PCB to use an LM358 though-hole part for the strain gauge amplifier
    - Rawnie prepped the op-amp confirguation on the breadboard 

#### Communication subsystem
##### UART debugging (Li/Deepika)
- soldered a test board with ISP, MCU, diode, and necessary connectors for UART
- UART cable has its own VCC/GND, since the original design of the PCB has the same VCC/GND, the UART's VCC/GND is suspected to create conflicts + shorting the board
- planning on using UART + LEDs to communicate with the user
- tested and confirmed the following program works (UART displays the converted analog value of MCU from the wheatstone bridge configuration)

```ino
#define LED1 PIN_PB2    // Pin for LED1 output
#define LED2 PIN_PD3    // Pin for LED2 output
#define LED3 PIN_PD7    // Pin for LED3 output

#define vdiff PIN_PC1     // Pin for wheatstone bridge 1 signal input
#define vdiff1 PIN_PC2    // Pin for wheatstone bridge 2 signal input
#define vdiff2 PIN_PC3    // Pin for wheatstone bridge 3 signal input

#define imu PIN_PC5       // Pin for IMU signal input

void setup() {
  // sensor layer subsystem inputs
  pinMode(vdiff, INPUT);
  pinMode(vdiff1, INPUT);
  pinMode(vdiff2, INPUT);
  pinMode(imu, INPUT);

  // communication subsystem LEDs
  pinMode(LED1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(LED2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(LED3, OUTPUT);

  Serial.begin(9600);  // Initialize serial communication at 9600 baud
}

void loop() {
  Serial.println("Hello World!");  // MCU sends "Hello World" followed by a newline

  // turn on all LEDs
  digitalWrite(LED1, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(LED2, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(LED3, HIGH);

  // read analog val (0-1023)
  int analog1 = analogRead(vdiff);

  // convert ADC val to voltage; 
  float VCC = 3.7;
  float voltage1 = (analog1 * VCC) / 1023.0;

  // print out analog value
  Serial.print("Voltage: ");
  Serial.print(voltage1, 4);  // 2 decimal places
  Serial.println(" V");
 
  delay(1000);  // Wait 1 second before repeating
}```
