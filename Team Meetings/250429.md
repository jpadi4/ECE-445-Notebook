**In attendance:**
- Deepika Batra
- Li Padilla
- Rawnie Singh

## Meeting agenda
- figure out what is causing UART issues

## What was accomplished
#### UART debugging (Li/Deepika)
- soldered a test board with ISP, MCU, diode, and necessary connectors for UART
- UART cable has its own VCC/GND, since the original design of the PCB has the same VCC/GND, the UART's VCC/GND is suspected to create conflicts + shorting the board

#### Communication subsystem
- planning on using UART + LEDs to communicate with the user
